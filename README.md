## Features And Labels
Machine learning systems operate on data sets that contain **features** and **labels**. The _features_ are the input data that the system trains on. The _labels_ are the output values that the system is trying to accurately predict.

In mathematical notation, we write down a machine learning system like this:
y' = M ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , . . . )

where:

* **y'** is the label predicted by the machine learning system (compared to the ground truth **y**)
* **x1, x2, x3, ...** are input features read by the machine learning system
* **M** is the model, an algorithm that makes predictions based on the input data.
